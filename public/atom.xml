    <updated>2014-03-16T15:15:39-05:00</updated>
    <id>agocs.org/blog/2014/03/16/intro-to-golang-presentation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey everybody, check out this intro to the Go programming language I put together for a talk at Backstop the other week!</p>

<p><a href="http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/camerazn/GolangIntro/golangIntro.slide#1" title="Hosted on go-talks.appspot.com">Golang Slides</a></p>

<p>I tried to keep the slides content-light, since I find that having too many things on the screen distracts from what I&rsquo;m saying. I&rsquo;ll recapitulate my notes below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Title slide. Blah blah blah.</li>
<li><ul>
<li><p><strong>Around since 2009</strong>
Go started as a research project at Google in 2007. It was released as an open source project in 2009, and Go 1.0 dropped in March of 2012. It&rsquo;s a real-live language!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Static Typing</strong>
Kinda &mdash;> Go uses Type Inference, but variables are statically typed once the type has been inferred. This is a reaction to the popularity of languages like JavaScript and Python, and gets away from the &ldquo;cumbersome type systems&rdquo; used in the C family and Java.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Object Oriented</strong>
Kinda &mdash;> Go is object oriented, but it doesn&rsquo;t have classes. I&rsquo;ll get into this later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Garbage Collected</strong>
Yes.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What is it good at? Some of the notable features are quick compile times (which it achieves through clean dependency analysis and no wasted imports or declarations), creation of statically linked binaries, and concurrency, which I dive into later.</p></li>
<li><p>Why Go?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Systems Programming</strong> Go represents a next big step in systems programming. Systems programming is the creation of OSes, utilities, drivers, and so-forth. It has to be fast, resource-conscious, and rock solid. C has been the big name in systems programming, but that came out in 1972. C++ came out in 79, and since there, what has there been? D? PL/8? Go and Mozilla Rust are the two up and coming names in systems programming for this century.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multicore Computers</strong> Moore&rsquo;s law no longer applies. We&rsquo;re making computers faster by cramming more and more cores onto a processor and more and more processors onto a motherboard. If you look at concurrency support in C or Java or any other enterprise language, it&rsquo;s all abysmal. Go has primitives for concurrency built in. It&rsquo;s so beautiful, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make Programming Fun</strong> I think so, at least. At the end of the talk, we wrote a little application that measures response time to a handful of websites and screwed around with it for a while. Not to toot my own horn, but a fellow dev told me it was &ldquo;one of the best live coding exercises he had ever seen.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hello World</strong> Nothing special here. &lsquo;fmt&rsquo; is the formatting package in Go&rsquo;s standard library, much like Stdio.h.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic syntax</strong> What I wanted to call out here is the difference between Go&rsquo;s function declaration syntax and that in the C family. C-style declaration is really focused on what a variable / function evaluates to, while Go is more focused on what the thing <em>is</em>. I talked a little bit about the Clockwise-Spiral rule.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Static Typing and Type Inference</strong> I talked about how you declare variables. <code>myName</code> is in the global address space, while <code>myAge</code> is local to the <code>main</code> method. Some key points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>myAge := 26</code> &mdash; <code>:=</code> is a shorthand form of declaration and assignment that only works in the local scope. Here, Go&rsquo;s type inference is assuming that I want <code>myAge</code> to be an int.</p></li>
<li><p><code>var myAge = 26</code> is just a longhand version of the above.</p></li>
<li><p><code>var myAge int64 = 26</code> &mdash; Let&rsquo;s say we live in a world where people live a very long time. Here, I&rsquo;m overriding Go&rsquo;s type inference and telling Go that <code>myAge</code> will be a 64 bit int.</p></li>
<li><p><code>myAge := 28 / myAge= := 26</code> Let&rsquo;s say I made a mistake and went to reassign 26 to <code>myAge</code>. I can&rsquo;t do it this way; the compiler says &ldquo;You already declared <code>myAge</code>, dumbass.&rdquo; If you erase the <code>:</code> on the  second line, you can reassign <code>myAge</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>myBrother := "Rob"</code> &mdash; We can&rsquo;t declare a variable without using it. It throws a compiler error. This is part of how Go keeps compile times down.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Object Orientation &mdash; Here&rsquo;s a quick example of how Go is object oriented. We&rsquo;re declaring a struct called littleBox that holds a couple of ints. We can create a litteBox and use it.</p></li>
<li><p>More Object Orientation &mdash; Here, we&rsquo;re declaring a littleBox and a bigBox that holds a littleBox. The function</p>

<p> <pre>func (bb bigBox) makeString() string {
     return fmt.Sprintf(&ldquo;contains %d books and %d baseball cards&rdquo;, bb.numBooks, bb.little.numBaseballCards)
 }</pre></p>

<p> creates a function on bigBox that makes it into a string. This is how Go is object oriented, but eschews classes. Whats <em>neat</em> is, if you change <code>func (bb bigBox) makeString()</code> into <code>func (bb bigBox) String()</code>, and change <code>fmt.Println(myBigBox.makeString())</code> into <code>fmt.Println(myBigBox)</code>, you&rsquo;ve made bigBox <em>implement</em> the Stringer interface! Did you explicitly do this? No! But you did it anyway! Isn&rsquo;t that awesome?</p></li>
<li><p>Compile times are quick. I wish I had a really big example to show you, but suffice to say that, every time you click &ldquo;Run&rdquo; on the presentation, the code is being sent back to the server, compiled, run, and the result is sent back to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Go compiles to native binaries. To demonstrate this, I opened iTerm, ran <code>go build hello_world.go</code>, then ran <code>file hello_world</code> to demonstrate that <code>hello_world</code> had compiled to a binary. Then I moved <code>hello_world</code> to <code>/opt/local/bin</code> and ran <code>hello_world</code>, which, of course, output:</p>

<p><pre>
cagocs:~ christopheragocs$ hello_world
Hello, world!
</pre></p></li>
<li><p>Go comes with a number of primitives to handle concurrency. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Goroutines</strong> &mdash; you can think of these as being super light, cheap threads. What really happens is a new stack frame is created in the same address space as the parent, and concurrent goroutines are multiplexed using threads. All of the actual thread juggling is handled behind the scenes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Channels</strong> &mdash; these are concurrency-safe buffers used for communication between goroutines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Select</strong> &mdash; selects between receiving channels.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Here&rsquo;s a purposefully slow example. <code>aBigNumber</code> calls a naive recursive implementation of the Fibonacci function, which delays execution for a few seconds. <code>aSmallNumber</code> either never gets a chance to execute, or executes much later.</p></li>
<li><p>In this one, we&rsquo;ve created a channel called <code>results</code>. We&rsquo;ve prefixed the calls to <code>aSmallNumber()</code> and <code>aBigNumber()</code> with the <code>go</code> keyword, which tells Go to execute them in separate goroutines. Both functions put the result onto the <code>results</code> channel, and the main method reads the results off of the channel in that order. In this instance, it will print &ldquo;7&rdquo; first, and then whatever the huge fib(42) is (or else execution on the remote server will time out first).</p></li>
<li><p>This was the programming exercise. You can look at the code on Github. In short, it accesses 24 different websites concurrently, and prints out the site, the access time, and the status code in order of completion. I wrote this with a really great group of developers, and we went off on a number of tangents trying different things to figure out some deep implementation details of Go (which explains the <code>time.Sleep(1000000000)</code> on line 30.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I used the &ldquo;Present&rdquo; tool, which is part of the Golang tool kit. I enjoyed using it, as it lets you use code examples pretty heavily, and the code examples can be modified in-browser and executed live. When I posted the talk on Facebook, an old professor of mine asked me about that, which I thought was pretty cool.</p>

<p>Giving the talk to the developers I work with was a lot of fun. Backstop Solutions employs a bunch of really smart people, and it&rsquo;s a pleasure when they ask deep probing questions that go beyond your knowledge. A++++, 10 stars, would present again.</p>

    <link href="agocs.org/blog/2013/09/10/cold-brew-coffee-try-1/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-10T22:34:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>agocs.org/blog/2013/09/10/cold-brew-coffee-try-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I saw a Kickstarter for a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bruer/cold-bruer-a-cold-brew-coffee-system?ref=recently_launched">cold brew coffee device</a> today, and I started reading about it. Cold Brew is supposed to taste different from your traditional hot brews &mdash; it gets less of the acidic flavors than traditionally brewed coffee, so you wind up with a smoother beverage. Also, cold brew techniques produce a coffee concentrate that you&rsquo;re supposed to dilute, and the idea of mixing up 50/50 cold brew and milk is interesting.</p>

<p>I had a Twitter exchange with my friend <a href="http://www.killpack.biz/resume.html">Jordan Killpack</a> about cold brewin&#8217;, and we determined that the Kickstarter device, while nicely engineered, was a little highfalutin. I decided to try my own cold brew using nothing but mason jars and coffee filters (and coffee, and water).</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Starbucks Blonde Roast, pre-ground (don&rsquo;t judge, it was on sale and all the good coffee places were closed at this point)</p></li>
<li><p>Two one-cup Mason jars with canning lids</p></li>
<li><p>Two standard paper coffee filters</p></li>
<li><p>Water</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Going off of the <a href="http://www.americastestkitchenfeed.com/recipes/homemade-cold-brew-coffee/">America&rsquo;s Test Kitchen recipe</a>, I put 60g coffee in the mason jar and added 240g water. After a few minutes, I stirred. I&rsquo;m going to let it sit until tomorrow night, and then I&rsquo;ll try it out.</p>

<h3>Pictures:</h3>

<p><a href="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/misc/29939745_7n8ptc#!i=2758217838&amp;k=6BZpvCS&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A"><img src="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/misc/i-6BZpvCS/0/L/20130910_215129-L.jpg" alt="Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug" /></a></p>

<p>On the right is coffee + water that&rsquo;s been sitting for about 10 minutes. I just finished stirring the one on the left.</p>

<p><a href="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/misc/29939745_7n8ptc#!i=2758217643&amp;k=99wChNd&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A"><img src="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/misc/i-99wChNd/0/L/20130910_215215-L.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>On the right is the prototype for how I&rsquo;m going to filter the coffee tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll just invert the assembly over a bowl or big cup and let it all drain. I&rsquo;ll update with how it worked out.</p>

    <link href="agocs.org/blog/2013/08/09/moving-a-post-mortem/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-09T23:34:48-05:00</updated>
    <id>agocs.org/blog/2013/08/09/moving-a-post-mortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, I moved from Atlanta to Chicago. Moving always sucks; that&rsquo;s a universal constant*, but I think this one went better than most. I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of what worked and what didn&rsquo;t, and some notes on what to do better next time.</p>

<h2>What Worked</h2>

<h4>Trello</h4>

<p>Sabrina and I planned the move and tracked our tasks on Trello.com. I have to say, the ability to put together dynamic kanban-style task boards on the fly really helped us keep everything straight.</p>

<h4>Penske Trucks</h4>

<p>We rented a 26&#8221; straight truck from Penske for this move. That&rsquo;s a big truck, but I decided it&rsquo;s better to have more truck than you need. It cost me less than $500 renting from Saturday &ndash; Wednesday, but what I neglected to consider was, on a move of that distance, I would need around 100 gallons of diesel fuel (right around $300-400).</p>

<p>Another consideration is height &mdash; the truck was specified at 12&#8217;7&#8221;. That&rsquo;s short enough to clear most bridges, but I did come across one 12&#8217;6&#8221; bridge in downtown Chicago.</p>

<p>Bridges aside, the Penske truck was comfortable and easy to drive. The AC worked great, and the stereo had an Aux input for my phone. It turned about as expected (surprisingly tight for a 30 foot truck), but it accelerated reasonably quickly and cruised comfortably at 70. I was concerned about a mountain in Monteagle, TN, but the truck made it up the grade easily when I dropped down to 5th, and I was never concerned about a runaway on the way down (again, engine braking in 4th or 5th).</p>

<h4>Audible.com</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long, long, long drive from Atlanta to Chicago. I made it better by listening to <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I&rsquo;ll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments </em>by David Foster Wallace, purchased through Audible. Audible made it really easy to pick an audiobook based on length (I didn&rsquo;t want to buy the 44 hour <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em>), and I actually turned to my Amazon recommendations for the book itself.</p>

<p>The first essay in <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing</em>, entitled &ldquo;Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley&rdquo;, is about DFW&rsquo;s childhood in rural Illinois. It was interesting hearing his thoughts on the Illinois geography through the eyes of a child athlete.</p>

<h4>Rent-A-Crate</h4>

<p>Cardboard boxes suck.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase that: Poorly assembled, poorly packed cardboard boxes suck. A properly assembled and packed cardboard box will bear (most of) the weight of the box(es) above it without destroying your stuff. An over-packed cardboard box means that the weight of the boxes above it is now being supported by your stuff, and when you&rsquo;re in frenzied packing mode, it&rsquo;s really easily to get sloppy in assembling and packing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a company called Rent-A-Crate with offices in several major cities around the country. They&rsquo;ll rent you these big orange crates for $3.50/crate/10 day period. They&rsquo;re sturdy, they nest, they stack stably, and they kick ass. I discovered that 20 crates fit into the back of my station wagon &mdash; just. I rented 25, and wound up taking them back in batches of 15 and 10.</p>

<p>The only drawback (and some may see this as a positive) is that they force you to unpack your stuff, because you&rsquo;re paying for the crates otherwise.</p>

<h4>The Home Depot</h4>

<p>I used to live down the street from not one but two Home Depot stores. It was great being able to run to The Home Depot to pick up bubble wrap, tape, more boxes (caveat, see previous section), and even the big god damn truck.</p>

<h4>Waze</h4>

<p>I relied on Waze, a navigation app for my Android phone, to get me to Chicago. It&rsquo;s interesting because it dynamically rerouts you based on traffic, and it took me up US41, a rural highway that divides Indiana and Illinois, while Google took my girlfriend and her mother up I-65 through Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Right as the sun was setting, the lightning bugs over the fields to either side of US41 were a sight to see.</p>

<h4>Movers</h4>

<p>One thing I realized was that it would be a huge pain in the ass getting everything up and down stairs. We used Simple Moving Labor to hire movers in Atlanta and Chicago. These guys wrapped all of our furniture up securely and handled the heavy lifting and truck packing much better than we ever could have done. They were self-directed, and really knew their business They were around $350 on each end, but well worth the cost.</p>

<h2>What Didn&rsquo;t</h2>

<h4>Cardboard Boxes</h4>

<p>Like I said earlier, a poorly assembled, poorly packed cardboard box quickly becomes a mushy paper bag with broken crap inside that you eventually have to dispose of. Guess what we had a bunch of!</p>

<h4>Moving the cats</h4>

<p>A few days before the move, I went to the pet supply store and picked up a big kennel on clearance. Sabrina went to the vet, and was given Xanax (seriously, human Xanax in human doses). We dosed the cats the morning of, and they liked it at first. Abby sat in the window, purring to herself, and Panther was jumping around swatting at things that weren&rsquo;t there. When we put them in the car, however, they haaaated it so bad. Sabrina said that they were meowing non-stop, and at one point they actually started to fight. Maybe we&rsquo;ll try some sort of sedative next time.</p>

<p>Having too much stuff</p>

<p>Seriously. I have no place for a telescope in Chicago! I should have started selling things months before.</p>

<h4>Moving my car</h4>

<p>Sabrina&rsquo;s Mom can drive a stick shift, so she drove it up. I&rsquo;m not saying anything, but she might not be as good as the thinks she is. The car made it up in one piece, but I would have been a lot more comfortable if it had been moved professionally.</p>

<h2>What would I do differently?</h2>

<p>Well, thank goodness, I don&rsquo;t have to move for another four years at least. I&rsquo;m going to start saving now, and maybe, just maybe, we&rsquo;ll hire a full service moving company. Sabrina and I will just get on a plane (and, doubtless, arrive to a pair of unhappy cats).</p>

<p>*Seriously, the easiest move I ever had was the one where my house burned down.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hate capslock. It&rsquo;s a horrible, horrible key, and it gets even more in the way on my split ergonomic keyboards at work. I&rsquo;ve tried registry hacks to kill it, but they don&rsquo;t seem to work. Here&rsquo;s how I deal with capslock:</p>

<ol>
<li> Obtain a small, flat-headed screwdriver. Insert it beneath the Capslock key.

<p>If you ever need capslock later, just use a pen to poke the little capacitive sensor. I put the key into a drawer in case I ever need to reassemble the keyboard later.</p>

    <link href="agocs.org/blog/2013/05/17/reverse-engineering-doubleclick-part-ii/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-17T10:27:30-05:00</updated>
    <id>agocs.org/blog/2013/05/17/reverse-engineering-doubleclick-part-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once every three seconds, that&rsquo;s the magic number.</p>

<p>Some more interesting information: I pointed a Doubleclick click counter at a super-simple web service I wrote, running on a web server I rent, and I ran a test that follows the DLCK redirect. Here are the results:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Delay_Between_Requests.png"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Delay_Between_Requests-300x113.png" alt="Delay_Between_Requests" /></a></p>

<p>I ran 300 clicks at 4s per click, then 500 clicks at 2s per click. As you can see, almost all of the first 300 clicks made it to the web service, but only around 380/500 2s per click clicks made it. Here&rsquo;s the same graph with a log scale y axis:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Delay_Between_Requests_log_scale.png"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Delay_Between_Requests_log_scale-300x113.png" alt="Delay_Between_Requests_log_scale" /></a></p>

<p>You can see that the first 300 clicks made it with roughly 3 seconds between clicks (modulo some variance in the first 100 because I was using a gaussian random delay, and a hiccough at #100 because I stopped and restarted the test). The 380 clicks that made it at 2s per click mostly showed up in 2s intervals, but there were at least seven delays of greater than 10 seconds. In fact, I determined that if there was a delay of >4 seconds, it was almost certain that clicks received during this delay would not be delivered. This indicates to me that DLCK is actively watching for clickthrough rates of greater than a certain amount from a certain IP address, and dropping clicks.</p>

<p>Neat!</p>

<p>I tried spoofing DLCK cookies. I have yet to be successful.</p>

    <link href="agocs.org/blog/2013/05/07/reverse-engineering-doubleclick-ad-statistics-part-1/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-07T12:44:16-05:00</updated>
    <id>agocs.org/blog/2013/05/07/reverse-engineering-doubleclick-ad-statistics-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the projects I&rsquo;m on seeks to proxy web beacons. Basically, I have a WSGI app that serves a 1x1 px gif, and then triggers a Celery app that goes out and actually &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; on the intended web beacon. During preliminary load testing with a Doubleclick beacon (actually a Doubleclick link counter), we discovered that requesting that beacon 1000 times in 5 minutes (one request ever 1/3 second) only reported around 30 &ldquo;clicks.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve been throwing tests at Doubleclick to see what it reports under different scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1000 clicks evenly distributed over 5 minutes: 30 clicks</p></li>
<li><p>1000 clicks chunked into 50 groups of 20 (I misunderstood how JMeter works): 50 clicks</p></li>
<li><p>300 clicks over an hour (1 per 12 seconds): 300 clicks</p></li>
<li><p>500 clicks with spoofed User_agent strings (1 per 12 seconds): 500 clicks</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So it appears that Doubleclick has a &ldquo;cooldown&rdquo; between clicks and doesn&rsquo;t really care about the User_agent. How long is that cooldown? We know it&rsquo;s greater than 1/3 second and less than 12 seconds.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m running a test that looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>Number of clicks</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rate of clicks</strong></p>

<p><strong>Delay between clicks</strong></p>

<p><strong>Total time</strong></p>

<p>10240</p>

<p>240 per minute</p>

<p>.25 seconds</p>

<p>2560 s (42.6m)</p>

<p>5120</p>

<p>120 per minute</p>

<p>.5 seconds</p>

<p>2560 s (42.6m)</p>

<p>2560</p>

<p>80 per minute</p>

<p>.75 seconds</p>

<p>1920 s (32m)</p>

<p>1280</p>

<p>40 per minute</p>

<p>1.5 seconds</p>

<p>1920 s (32m)****</p>

<p>640</p>

<p>20 per minute</p>

<p>3 seconds</p>

<p>1920 s (32m)</p>

<p>320</p>

<p>10 per minute</p>

<p>6 seconds</p>

<p>1920 s (32m)</p>

<p>By taking the total number of clicks recorded today (which I&rsquo;ll know tomorrow), I&rsquo;ll be able to start approximating the cooldown (for example, if I see 2240 and change clicks, I&rsquo;ll know that the cooldown is between 1.5 and .75 seconds).</p>

<p>Will update later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It bothered me that the spices in the kitchen were out of order. So, I sorted them using my favorite sorting algorithm, Mergesort. My cats helped.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-33-19_905.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-33-19_905-300x168.jpg" alt="2013-05-04_23-33-19_905" /></a></p>

<p>I started with an un-ordered list of spices.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-34-08_418.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-34-08_418-300x168.jpg" alt="2013-05-04_23-34-08_418" /></a></p>

<p>Then I started to divide the list up into smaller lists. Panther helped.</p>

<p>31 elements became 15 and 16.</p>

<p>Then 7, 8, 8, 8.</p>

<p>Then 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4.</p>

<p>Then 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-35-32_948.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-35-32_948-300x168.jpg" alt="2013-05-04_23-35-32_948" /></a></p>

<p>Then the sorting began. Each two element group, I sorted. Then I treated each one as a queue. For each set of two queues, I dequeued the head element of lowest alphabetical value, and enqueued it into a result queue. I repeated this until there was only one, sorted queue remaining.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-46-38_85.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-04_23-46-38_85-300x168.jpg" alt="2013-05-04_23-46-38_85" /></a></p>

<p>Then I put it back into the spice cabinet! When Sabrina asks, &ldquo;Who got my spices out of order,&rdquo; I will reply, &ldquo;I got them <em>in</em> order.&rdquo;</p>

    <id>agocs.org/blog/2013/04/23/how-to-urlencode-a-string-in-c-using-net-4-0-or-less</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The boffins over at Microsoft added a handy method to .Net 4.5: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webutility.urlencode.aspx">Webutility.UrlEncode</a>. Unfortunately for those of us who don&rsquo;t have Visual Studio 2012, we can&rsquo;t use it! How then can we properly encode strings for use in URLs?</p>

<p>(What do I mean? Let&rsquo;s say I want to pass a URL inside another URL as an argument. So, for example, I want to pass <a href="http://www.bar.com/?a=b&amp;c=d%C2%A0_as">http://www.bar.com/?a=b&amp;c=d%C2%A0_as</a> a query string variable_ to foo.com. I&rsquo;d want the following URL: <a href="http://foo.com/?url=http%3A//www.bar.com/%3Fa%3Db%26c%3Dd">http://foo.com/?url=http%3A//www.bar.com/%3Fa%3Db%26c%3Dd</a>  )</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I did it:</p>

<p>I start by instantiating a StringBuilder with assumed length of 100 (I&rsquo;m not going to create a URL much longer than 100 characters, am I?). Then, for each character in the input URL, I call the replace(char c) function. Replace returns the string that the character <em>should</em> be, and that value gets appended to the StringBuilder. When we&rsquo;re done, the StringBuilder spits out the string.</p>

<p>I thought about doing an in-place replace, but that would have lead to a lot of shuffling within the string. My intuition told me the runtime would be somewhere along the lines of O(n<sup>2</sup>). I also thought about chaining a bunch of String.replace().replace().replace()&hellip; calls together, but that would have been a mess as well as a slow performer.</p>

<p>I wound up traded some space for time (yes, I am initializing a bunch of Strings), but I&rsquo;m effectively performing this encoding in O(n) time.</p>

    <link href="agocs.org/blog/2013/04/22/box-fan-beef-jerky-part-2/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-22T21:19:20-05:00</updated>
    <id>agocs.org/blog/2013/04/22/box-fan-beef-jerky-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.agocs.org/box-fan-beef-jerky-part-1/">this post</a>, I started making box fan beef jerky. If you can&rsquo;t remember where I was when I left off, go take a peek.</p>

<p>Okay, so. The meat sat in the marinade overnight, and come morning I loaded it onto a 20&#8221; by 20&#8221; HVAC filter, courtesy of The Home Depot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_07-32-50_747.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_07-32-50_747-300x168.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The cats were very interested.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_07-32-55_320.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_07-32-55_320-300x168.jpg" alt="2013-04-18_07-32-55_320" /></a></p>

<p>I assembled the filters and strapped them to the fan.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_19-22-01_231.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_19-22-01_231-300x168.jpg" alt="2013-04-18_19-22-01_231" /></a></p>

<p>The cats were very interested.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_07-37-39_570.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_07-37-39_570-300x170.jpg" alt="2013-04-18_07-37-39_570" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looked like after a day at work:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_22-29-49_87.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-18_22-29-49_87-300x168.jpg" alt="2013-04-18_22-29-49_87" /></a></p>

<p>Tasty, but not properly preserved. I cut up the pieces too thick, originally. The above picture is after re-cutting, and before re-drying overnight.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any pictures of the next morning, but the results are good. The jerky had a nice, mellow flavor, and has kept in a tupperware on the counter over the course of the week. Sabrina put the bug in my head to make Sriracha beef jerky&hellip; guess what I&rsquo;m doing this weekend!</p>

    <updated>2013-04-17T19:01:59-05:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I realized this morning that I&rsquo;m about six months late in changing my air conditioner filter. I was in Home Depot, and I thought, &ldquo;You know what goes really well with air filters? Beef jerky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m an unabashed Alton Brown fan. I saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIK4DVLHf7Y">this </a>episode of Good Eats a few years ago, and I occasionally think, &ldquo;Huh, I could do that.&rdquo; Well, I bought three of the cheapest 20x20 filters and 1.5 pounds of flank steak, and got to work, following <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe/index.html">this recipe</a>.</p>

<p>I placed the steak in the freezer while I did the prep work for the <a href="http://www.agocs.org/cast-iron-skillet-pizza/">Cast Iron Skillet Pizza</a>, then while that was in the oven I staged my Ingredients!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-46-29_403.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-46-29_403-300x168.jpg" alt="Bottles of ingredients, in a row." /></a></p>

<p>Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, honey, pepper, onion powder, and ancho chile powder. <a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-52-22_375.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-52-22_375-300x168.jpg" alt="Bowl of mixed juices." /></a></p>

<p>I mixed up the ingredients above in roughly the ratios called for in the recipe (I skipped the liquid smoke. Can&rsquo;t stand liquid smoke), and set that aside. Then I got the meat out of the freezer and started slicing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_19-00-15_977.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_19-00-15_977-300x168.jpg" alt="1.5 pounds of flank steak sliced into strips." /></a></p>

<p>I cut the meat into thin strips, then cut the longer of those strips in half. Some of the strips were a little fat, so I cut them in half width-wise. Overall, I&rsquo;d say I cut the meat into &frac12;&#8221; strips.</p>

<p>After that, I put the meat into a gallon sized ziplock with the marinade, shook that up a good bit, and popped it in the fridge. Part 2 <a href="http://www.agocs.org/box-fan-beef-jerky-part-2/">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am the proud owner of a Lodge 10&#8221; Cast Iron Skillet. I bought it at the Lodge Factory Store in Tennessee for, like, $12 because of a small blemish. I&rsquo;d heard about making pizza in a cast iron skillet, and tonight, I thought, why not? I largely used this guy&rsquo;s recipe (minus the part where he made his own dough and sauce. Maybe later.): <a href="http://www.macheesmo.com/2011/03/cast-iron-pizza/">http://www.macheesmo.com/2011/03/cast-iron-pizza/</a></p>

<p>One trip to Whole Foods later, and I had some Ingredients!</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_51&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-24-05_828.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-24-05_828-300x168.jpg" alt="Some ingredients for the pizza. Sauce, pancetta, mozzarella, and dough." /></a> Some ingredients for the pizza. Sauce, pancetta, mozzarella, and dough.[/caption]</p>

<p>I chopped up some mushrooms and spinach to go on top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-27-23_877.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-27-23_877-300x168.jpg" alt="Mushrooms and spinach, chopped up." /></a></p>

<p>The dough was really stretchy and tough to work with&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-28-39_554.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-28-39_554-168x300.jpg" alt="A wad of pizza dough stretching from my hand." /></a></p>

<p>&hellip; but I got it into the pan. Kinda ugly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-34-57_604.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-34-57_604-300x168.jpg" alt="Ugly dough in the cast iron skillet." /></a></p>

<p>I did my best to smooth it out, but it was still really uneven. I was worried this would be an issue. Oh well, sauce and toppings on!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-36-26_808.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_18-36-26_808-300x168.jpg" alt="Raw pizza in the skillet with sauce, spinach, and mushrooms." /></a></p>

<p>I added the cheese on top of that, then the pancetta on top of the cheese. At this point, I let the oven pre-heat to 450 degrees F while I did other things.</p>

<p>At three minutes to go, I put the skillet on a burner set to high in order to pre-heat the skillet. It started to sizzle a little bit just before the timer went off, but I don&rsquo;t think it affected anything much.</p>

<p>I popped it into the oven, checked it at 15 minutes, and removed it around 17 or 18 minutes. The pizza slid right out of the pan with just a little encouragement from a spatula.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_19-07-29_963.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-17_19-07-29_963-300x168.jpg" alt="The whole thing sitting on a plate." /></a></p>

<p>It was really, really good. The crust baked up really thick, and was a bit chewier than I would perhaps have liked. The pancetta gave it a really nice saltyness, which helped the flavor of the sauce (which, I thought, was a little too bright). I cut it into quarters, and Sabrina and I polished it off.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was working on a piece of code today, and I decided to refactor some of it. &ldquo;This method is beginning to smell bad,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;I should break this series of if/thens off into a different method.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thing led to another, and soon enough I had some considerably better-structured, more readable code. But did it <em>work?</em> As luck would have it, this is the first project I&rsquo;d gotten a chance to build from the ground up, and as such, the first project I&rsquo;d been able to build with a whole stanking lot of test coverage.</p>

<p>Well, I ran the tests. Bam! No, broken, syntax error, of course that variable doesn&rsquo;t exist, I got rid of it. Fix, fix, test again, and voila! Not only is my code cleaner and more readable, but I can objectively say it still does what it should do!</p>

<p>Thanks, TDD!</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Thinking about it from the comfort of my own home, I realized an improvement i should have made. You know what? Test driven development will be there in the morning to help me not make a huge mess of things.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I know I&rsquo;m way behind the curve on the Arduino. I got caught in a vicious cycle of, &ldquo;Can I justify ordering an Arduino? No, I don&rsquo;t really have a project for it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Should I start this project? No, I don&rsquo;t really have an Arduino.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well all that changed, because I have an Arduino now (finally! Gosh!). I&rsquo;d ordered a bag of resistors and LEDs on Amazon, and I have a passive IR motion sensor, so while watching Watership Down this evening I assembled my very first project.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-04_23-06-55_852.jpg"><img src="http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-04_23-06-55_852-300x168.jpg" alt="Arduino Motion Sensor" /></a></p>

<p>It <em>lights up</em> when it <em>detects motion! </em>(Also pictured: popcorn.) Earth-shattering, I know. But sometimes, it feels good to knock out a simple project. I haven&rsquo;t done microcontroller work for years, and it&rsquo;s fun!</p>
