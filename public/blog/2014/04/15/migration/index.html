	<h2 class="title">Server Migration</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>I know my site doesn&rsquo;t exactly have any dedicated watchers, but if anyone noticed a period of downtime earlier this week, it&rsquo;s because I was migrating from hosting on FatCow to hosting on a rented VPS through DigitalOcean. I also moved my domain registration from FatCow to Gandi.net. In this post, I plan to cover the hows, whys, and some lessons learned.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the juicy stuff.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>There are a couple of reasons, but the root of it all is that I got fed up with FatCow. It&rsquo;s not clear how their pricing <strike>varies</strike> increases from year to year, and it&rsquo;s obnoxious how, every few months, I find myself signed up for another &ldquo;free trial&rdquo; of some service out of which I have to opt. I can roll my own solution for less money, and with greater control.</p>

<h2>Why move away from FatCow?</h2>

<p>Like I said above, money and annoyance. I have a few sites with FatCow, and the oldest is about to round the three year mark. When I signed up, I was offered a trial rate of around $30 for the first year. That&rsquo;s a very good deal. I barely used the site, but I ignored a few emails and, lo and behold, I found myself renewed automatically to the tune of $70-something. Okay, that&rsquo;s still not significantly more than $5/month. Pretty darn good for unlimited hosting, the fact that I&rsquo;m not using it notwithstanding. I turned off automatic renewal.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I got a message saying that FatCow couldn&rsquo;t automatically renew that site because the card information I had stored was bad. I logged in, turned automatic renewal off again, and looked at the invoice &mdash; they were about to bill me $200-something for April 2014-April 2015! No way! That&rsquo;s way too much.</p>

<p>I just renewed Agocs.org to the tune of $70-something with FatCow, but I decided it was in my best interests to break ties with that company completely, something I will be doing over the next few weeks.</p>

<h2>Why Gandi.net?</h2>

<p>Bluntly, they have a &ldquo;no bullshit&rdquo; policy. That, and they were recommended by a trusted coworker and friend, and they are a French corporation and French law meaningfully allows them to transfer ownership of &ldquo;Agocs.org&rdquo; over to me (most American registrars, I have been informed, retain ownership of the domain name and license its usage to you).</p>

<p>The process of getting things set up with Gandi.net was a little rocky, as I will detail below, but they have a bunch of good help text and an extensive knowledge base. I was able to get up and running quickly and with minimal bugging of my more knowledgeable friends.</p>

<h2>Why DigitalOcean?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve hosted a few VPSs with DigitalOcean before, and they are a joy to work with. I get full control of a Linux box (something I never got from FatCow), I can choose my web server (Nginx all the way) and database back-end (none for me please!), and set it up however I want. Write a script that uses rsync to publish new articles? Sure! Go nuts! I fought with FatCow for a while about that, and resorted to using FTP (which, once you&rsquo;ve started using rsync, sucks).</p>

<p>Anyway, one small VPS costs me about five bones per month. Because I&rsquo;m just the tiniest bit clever, I can host several sites on the same VPS. They&rsquo;re all static content generated by Octopress, so it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to outgrow the small server any time soon. It&rsquo;s <em>really</em> nice.</p>

<h1>How it worked</h1>

<p>The process was straightforward. I set up the VPS with DigitalOcean first, copied my site over there, installed Nginx, and got that configured. Then I requested a transfer code from FatCow (I suspect, but cannot confirm, that they drag their feet on this), and initiated the transfer through Gandi. The transfer cost me about $13, but that means Agocs.org is mine for an additional year. When the transfer was complete, I created a DNS Zone file through Gandi&rsquo;s web interface that points to my VPS.</p>

<h1>Lessons learned</h1>

<p>I made my fair share of mistakes, mostly in setting up the DNS Zonefile. My first attempt looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>* 10800 IN A 162.243.76.63
</code></pre>

<p>www.agocs.org worked great, but no email and no plain ol&#8217; agocs.org. Email was more critical, so around midnight that night I changed it to this:</p>

<pre><code>* 10800 IN A 162.243.76.63
imap 10800 IN CNAME access.mail.gandi.net.
pop 10800 IN CNAME access.mail.gandi.net.
smtp 10800 IN CNAME relay.mail.gandi.net.
@ 10800 IN MX 50 fb.mail.gandi.net.
@ 10800 IN MX 10 spool.mail.gandi.net.
</code></pre>

<p>The lines below were cribbed from Gandi.net&rsquo;s default Zone file. <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#99;&#x68;&#x72;&#105;&#115;&#x40;&#97;&#x67;&#111;&#x63;&#x73;&#46;&#x6f;&#x72;&#103;">&#99;&#x68;&#114;&#105;&#x73;&#64;&#97;&#103;&#x6f;&#x63;&#115;&#46;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x67;</a> worked, but agocs.org did not. I did some research and then made the following change:</p>

<pre><code>* 10800 IN A 162.243.76.63
@ 10800 IN A 162.243.76.63
imap 10800 IN CNAME access.mail.gandi.net.
pop 10800 IN CNAME access.mail.gandi.net.
smtp 10800 IN CNAME relay.mail.gandi.net.
@ 10800 IN MX 50 fb.mail.gandi.net.
@ 10800 IN MX 10 spool.mail.gandi.net.
</code></pre>

<p>I found out the * record points all _sub_domains to that IP address, but it does not point the root domain (i.e. agocs.org) there. The @ record points the root domain to that IP address.</p>

<p>Finally, I noticed a problem with sent email. The last change I had to make was through Gmail, which was sending agocs.org traffic through an SMTP server run by FatCow. I&rsquo;m way too lazy to roll my own SMTP server, so I told Gmail to take care of it.</p>

<p>There you have it.</p>
