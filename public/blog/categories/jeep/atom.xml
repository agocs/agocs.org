    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I shattered the sun visor bracket on my Jeep in the cold this winter, so I did the only sensible thing. I tried to machine a new one.</p>

<p>I started with a block of 2" by 4" aluminum stock. I cut 2" off of it with a band saw. The blade popped off of its guide with about 1/10" left to go, so fixing that was a fun diversion.</p>

<p>I finally got a piece mounted in the Bridgeport and milled a few reference surfaces. I sent this picture to my friend to ask about the finish on that side milling. He said it was normal, if a little fugly.</p>

<p>I call this picture, &ldquo;Where the hell did I put my calipers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite parts of machining. On the left, you can see the rough cut that&rsquo;s out-of-square. On the right, the machined surface.</p>

<p>I took a bunch more cuts, and got here.</p>

<p>Then I messed up.</p>

<p><a href="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-Btb5N32/A" title=""><img src="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-Btb5N32/0/L/20150301_215830-L.jpg" title="" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Notice the middle part? That would be perfect, if the sun visor stuck up. Of course, it hangs down, so this part is completely worthless. Fortunately, I have enough stock to make a second one.</p>
