    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the problems with Jeep Wrangler ownership is there&rsquo;s nowhere to store things out of sight. Your backpack, laptop, whatever, it&rsquo;s all hangin' out there in the open. Even when you&rsquo;ve zipped the top up, there&rsquo;s nothing between your valuables and a set of sticky fingers besides a thin sheet of clear vinyl.</p>

<p>I wanted to feel better about leaving things in the Jeep, and I wanted to design something sturdy so that I could still carry heavy things in the back of the Jeep. I also wanted to cut down on the general clutter in my cargo area, and I wanted to practice welding.</p>

<p>I imagined something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-WhDR5Qd/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-WhDR5Qd/0/L/IMG_20151213_233221-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>So I started with some rough measurements.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-pRWHkrf/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-pRWHkrf/0/XL/IMG_20160110_164946-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a top view and rear view of the back of the Jeep. I had 34.5" between the brackets where the rear seat would have mounted if I had one, 35" of length to work with, and 15.5" between the bottom of the opening and the bottom of the rear window.</p>

<p>So, to summarize, what I wanted was a drawer and a frame to hold that drawer that fit in the above-defined envelope. The frame would have to be reasonably sturdy, because I&rsquo;d like to put things on top of it too. I&rsquo;m the kind of person who thinks really well in design tools, so I fired up Autodesk and got to work.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-BkMSCKq/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-BkMSCKq/0/M/jeepbox0-M.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-f9XHK5m/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-f9XHK5m/0/M/jeepbox-M.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>This was the first pass, and some measurements. I ran it by some Internet folks, and they suggested diagonal bracing.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-C39GHxD/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-C39GHxD/0/M/jeepbox1-M.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>My plan was to attach a sheet of plywood to the top using T-nuts and cap screws, and to put roller bearings on the horizontal bars running along the sides to act as drawer slides. The T-nuts and cap screws were entirely reasonably priced through McMaster-Carr, but the roller bearings were about $5 ea. I found equivalent skate bearings on Amazon for about $1 ea.</p>

<p>Using the CAD drawings, I figured out what pieces I&rsquo;d need.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-bkW8ccS/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-bkW8ccS/0/L/IMG_20160110_165039-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-KpPPZbL/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-KpPPZbL/0/L/IMG_20160110_165045-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I did some math, and figured I could fit that into 19 pieces of 37" x &frac12;" square stock (N.B. I was wrong, and probably should have ordered 20 or 21 pieces). From Metals Supermarket, that was just over $50.</p>

<p>I got to welding.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-hZ3gTBj/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-hZ3gTBj/0/L/20151122202228-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-3THvt8F/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-3THvt8F/0/L/20151127145653-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Then I realized, I&rsquo;d have to mount this in the Jeep! I&rsquo;d figured I&rsquo;d use the rear seat belt mounting bolt, but I forgot to locate that with my previous measurements. I rectified that.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-vdQh37C/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-vdQh37C/0/L/IMG_20160110_165102-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I bought a sheet of flat steel stock, milled in a hole for the seat belt bolt, and welded that into place. A test-fit revealed that I&rsquo;d milled the hole in the wrong place, so I had to fix that, first with the angle grinder, then with a plasma cutter.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-vJ7hXHd/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-vJ7hXHd/0/L/IMG_20151213_161552-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Finally, it went to paint! I wanted to powder coat it, but I got a $150 quote for powder coating. A little rich for my blood. I used a can and a half of Rustoleum black enamel instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-CZvPjPL/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-CZvPjPL/0/L/IMG_20151213_161533-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>While that was curing, I designed the wooden top and drawer.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-M5HxzpL/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-M5HxzpL/0/L/IMG_20160110_165118-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-fzJvNqc/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-fzJvNqc/0/L/IMG_20160110_165126-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I decided to make it all out of &frac12;" plywood, cut from &frac12; sheets of plywood (because half sheets are easier to move than full sheets). The drawer, I figured I&rsquo;d just use brads and glue to hold it together. If it fell apart, I could always re-do it.</p>

<p>Because the wooden pieces were just rectangles, I let the robots take care of cutting them out.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-kXbHbZJ/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-kXbHbZJ/0/L/IMG_20151213_190147-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>The next night, I loaded up all the pieces and started attaching them together.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-9MDj4c5/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-9MDj4c5/0/L/IMG_20151215_214357-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-VKZjkqQ/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-VKZjkqQ/0/L/IMG_20151215_214523-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>The skate bearings I bought had an inner diameter that was just a little bigger than the screws I used, so I turned the screws into cones on the lathe to locate the bearings better (not pictured, but I wish I had).</p>

<p>Everything in the Jeep so far:</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-FbtLRtD/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-FbtLRtD/0/L/IMG_20151215_220627-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-cNtzdDR/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-cNtzdDR/0/L/IMG_20151215_220644-L.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been about a month since I finished all that, and I have the drawer together and installed; I just haven&rsquo;t taken pictures of it yet. It served us well on our trip to Georgia &mdash; our valuables went into the drawer, and my wife&rsquo;s big suitcase got strapped to the top.</p>
